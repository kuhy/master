      The high code quality makes the software more robust and sustainable and
      decreases technical debt. This thesis investigates the effect of code quality
      on the pull request acceptance and on pull request evaluation latency. This
      will help us understand if the project maintainers pay sufficient attention
      to the code quality. To unravel the code quality influence, I analyzed one hundred
      open-source projects from five different programming languages: Python, Java,
      Kotlin, Haskell, and C/C++. The code quality of the individual pull
      requests was evaluated using static code analysis. Several machine learning
      models were utilized to predict the pull request acceptance based on the code
      quality. The poor code quality seems to have a slight negative impact on the
      pull request acceptance. However, there seems to be no effect on the time
      required to close a pull request.
